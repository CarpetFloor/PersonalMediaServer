Client
-Make initial page look prettier before page loads
-Fix load animation too big and too far right on mobile devices
-Make sure video scalling maintains aspect ratio
-Make change directory and previous/ next buttons bigger on mobile
-Automatically resize everything on phone orientation change (probably just refresh page)
-Make photos and videos centered on screen on mobile
-Fix photos not fiting vertically in mobile landscape mode
-Make video z-index higher than canvas (loading animation)
-Clear loading animation interval when not playing
-Make loading animation stick around for a few seconds after video has loaded to avoid the short period where video isn't visible but loading animation is gone. Do so by a timeout, but set a var to timeout so can be cancelled incase another file is opened and is loading when timeout is called.
-Download videos and play instead of streaming
-Load photo thumbnails for all photos in opened directories
-Load video thumbnails for all videos in opened directories
-Animations
-Notify user if connection to server lost
