Adding media to the server:
    -To add any media to the server, drag all files or folders that you want into the "Media" folder.
    -You can organize your media in any way you want in the "Media" folder by adding as many folders as you want, just make sure that all media you add is in the "Media" folder.
    -Note that currently, only videos of type mp4, webm, and ogg are supported.
    -Also note that the file ".gitignore" in the "Media" folder can be deleted.

Controlling the server:
    -In order for other devices to access your media you have put on this server, you have to start the server by double-clicking the file "startServer.bat".
    -You will only be able to access your media when the server is running, so make sure you have a computer dedicated to running this server.
    -To stop the server, close out of the terminal window that opened up when you double-clicked "startServer.bat".
